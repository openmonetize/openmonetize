# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code.

## Adding a Changeset

To add a changeset, run:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

This will prompt you interactively to:

1. Select which packages have changed
2. Choose the change type (patch/minor/major)
3. Write a description of the change

The changeset file will be committed with your PR.

## Releasing

When ready to release:

```bash
pnpm changeset:version  # Updates versions and changelogs
pnpm changeset:publish  # Publishes to npm
```

Or simply push to `main` and the GitHub Action will create a "Version Packages" PR automatically.
